\arguments{
\item{fhwa_db}{Data frame containing the FAF interregional flow database in
format distributed by FHWA, or string containing path and filename
containing the same}

\item{target_year}{The four-digit simulation year as an integer value}

\item{interpolate}{A boolean variable denoting whether values for the
`target_year` should be interpolated between the two closest years if it is
not one of the years included in the FAF database (defaults to FALSE,
currently ignored)}

\item{internal_regions}{A set of one or more FAF regions internal to the
study area (optional, but must be specified if `external_regions` is
defined)}

\item{external_regions}{A data frame containing FAF region pairs whose flows
pass through the modeled area (optional, but if specified then
`internal_regions` must also be specified)}

\details{
This function converts the FHWA Freight Analysis Framework (FAF)
  commodity flows, measured in annual tons, dollars, and ton-miles
  between domestic FAF regions and external regions into annual flows
  for the specified year or closest to it in the FAF database. The `fhwa_db`
  can either be a data frame previously created with the contents of the
  FAF flow database or a fully-qualified pathname to the data in comma-
  separated value (CSV) format. The latter can be in a compressed format that
  readr::read_csv() can handle.

  It is important to note that the tons, value, and ton-miles are converted
  from implied thousands and millions of units in the source data. Zero
  values are retained, as they reportedly represent flows whose values are
  less than 1 unit (e.g., zero tons represent values between zero and one
  thousand tons since in the FAF tons are coded in implied thousands of
  tons).

  The `target_year` must be one of the years in the FAF database, or fall
  between two of the years included within it. Only data for the target or
  closest year is processed by this function. An optional `interpolate`
  parameter will eventually allow for the tons, value, and ton-miles to be
  interpolated between the two closest years to the target year. The
  parameter is included so as to not break the interface, but the
  functionality is not currently implemented.

  The `internal_regions` should be specified as a list of the FAF regions
  inside the modeled area. Flows to, from, and between these internal
  regions will be allocated to synthetic firms or traffic analysis zones
  within the model. Flows from the remainder of the USA will be retained if
  they have a trip end in one of the internal regions (e.g., internal,
  inbound, or outbound flows). The internal regions are optional, but if
  omitted data from the entire USA will be considered internal to the model.

  Flows likely to pass through one or more internal regions can be included
  as `external_regions`. Such flows must be defined as FAF region pairs (e.g.,
  truck flows between California and Washington on I-5 if Oregon comprises
  the internal regions). The flows are assumed to be bidirectional to reduce
  the amount of coding required. Note that any additional fields in
  `external_regions` will be added to the FAF flows records. The user should
  remove any unwanted fields before or after passing the `outer_region`
  definitions to this function.
