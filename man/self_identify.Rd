\title{Return the identity of the calling function and date string}
\usage{
self_identify(mc)
}
\arguments{
\item{mc}{The results of a match.call() function call from the calling
program}
}
\value{
The function returns a string with the calling function's name and
  the current date and time.
}
\description{
Return the identity of the calling function and date string
}
\details{
This function returns a string that identifies the calling 
  function and the time it was called. This is used to announce the start of
  each CT function in the logging output. You wouldn't think you'd have to
  go to this much work, but `match.call()` will return three identifying 
  strings if the function name is preceded by its package name--but of 
  course not in order: the double-colon comes first, then the package name,
  and finally the function. Unless there is no prefix, in which case the
  first element of the return value is what we're after. We try to handle
  both cases here.

print(self_identify(match.call())
