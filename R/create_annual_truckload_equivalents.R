#' Generate annual truckload equivalents using CVS and FAF4 truck factors
#'
#' @param faf_flows A tibble containing FAF truck commodity flow records for
#'   the current model year
#' @param truck_allocation_factors A tibble containing factors that map
#'   commodity flows to different truck types
#' @param payload_distributions A tibble containing the frequency or percentage
#'   of trucks by payload weight in the population for each distance band in the
#'   data
#' @param stop_frequencies A tibble containing the incidence of number of stops
#'   per truck tour (OD movement in the FAF data) by distance band (optional,
#'   defaults to NULL indicating that no stop frequencies will be applied)
#' @param cache_size An integer specifying the number of sampled trucks to be
#'   generated within each distance band (defaults to 1E6)
#' @param trace_flows Turns detailed tracing statements on or off (defaults to
#'   FALSE)
#'
#' @details This function creates a database of discrete truckload equivalents
#'   corresponding to each FAF commodity flow record. This conversion is meant
#'   to be carried out for trucks only, but could be expanded to include mixed
#'   modes of shipment that include trucking. This process represents a
#'   departure from earlier methods based on the FAF4 Freight Traffic
#'   Assignment report. Instead, trucks by type are generated using the FAF
#'   truck allocation factors with cargo weights sampled from observed distri-
#'   butions from the 2012 Canadian Commercial Vehicle Survey (CVS). A data-
#'   base of discrete trucks are created for each FAF commodity flow, with
#'   the sum of tonnage and value for corresponding synthetic trucks equal to
#'   the same values reported in the FAF.
