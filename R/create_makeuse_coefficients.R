#' Create input-output make and use coefficients from PECAS AA accounts
#'
#' @param pecas_makeuse A tibble containing statewide input-output flows in
#'   annual dollars, generated by the PECAS AA module
#' @param faf_data A tibble containing the reformatted Freight Analysis
#'   Framework (FAF) commodity flow for the simulated year
#'
#' @details This function converts the PECAS input-output flows by sector into
#'   make and use coefficients, used to map commodities produced or consumed by
#'   each sector (make and use coefficients, respectively). PECAS already
#'   splits flows between transportable and non-transportable commodities,
#'   making our job simpler. We simply have to put the data, which is produced
#'   for each year PECAS runs, into format we need. The transportable goods are
#'   defined using Standard Classification of Transportable Goods (SCTG) codes,
#'   which are also used in USDOT data, including their Freight Analysis
#'   Framework (FAF), which we uses to define inter-regional flows. We read the
#'   FAF data in this function to create a list of each commodity defined within
#'   it, which is compared to those found in the make-use data. An error is
#'   thrown if one or more commodities are found in the FAF that are not in the
#'   make-use data (although not vice-versa, for there might be local production
#'   not included in the inter-regional flows). The user can optionally save the
#'   derived coefficients in a text file in comma-separated value format.
