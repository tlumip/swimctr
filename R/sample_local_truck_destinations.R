#' Simple destination choice model for local (internal) truck trips
#'
#' @param truck_origins A tibble containing discrete daily trips for each tour,
#'   usually produced by a trip or tour generation function
#' @param skim_matrices A tibble containing skim distance and travel time for
#'   each origin-destination pair, usually only containing records for zone
#'   pairs that fall within user-defined threshold (i.e., excludes what would be
#'   only a long-distance trip)
#' @param utility_parameters A tibble containing weights for distance and
#'   attractors for each truck type defined in the simulation
#'
#' @details This is a simple destination choice model that mimics a singly-
#'   constrained gravity model. It samples eligible destinations based upon the
#'   product of interzonal distance and attractions, however defined. The
#'   distances are typically limited to a certain distance (120-180 miles),
#'   beyond which are considered the realm of long-distance trips. Different
#'   weights for distance (alpha1) and attractors (alpha2) ar defined for each
#'   truck type (and can be all set to unity to eliminate such scaling),
#'   otherwise known as utility parameters. In a typical gravity model
#'   formulation we divide the product of attractions and interzonal impedance
#'   by the sum of them for all zones. Sampling rather than calculating
#'   deterministic proportions obviates the need for this step. The output from
#'   this function is the same as the input truck origins, with the destination
#'   appended. The user can optionally also save this data frame in a comma-
#'   separated value file.
