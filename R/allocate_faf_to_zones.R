#' @param makeuse Data frame containing input-output make and use coefficient,

#' @param intermodal_connectors Data frame containing the location (traffic

#'   percentage of such flows originating and terminating within the FAF region
#'   they are situated in should be allocated to them
#' @param external_gateways Data frame containing the external stations (traffic

#'
#' @details This function allocates discrete daily FAF (inter-regional) truck
#'   flows, coded to FAF regions, to traffic analysis zones within the modeled
#'   area. Input-output coefficients are used to map the commodity carried by
#'   each truck (or formerly or next carried, in case of empty trucks) to the
#'   industry type most likely to produce or consume it. Employment within the
#'   chosen industry within all zones situated within the FAF region are sampled
#'   to choose the internal trip end. Finally, the flows are assigned to
#'   external gateways entering or leaving the region. For trucks, external FAF
#'   regions are associated with a particular gateway. Note that through truck
#'   trips are coded to two external gateways. For import or export flows the
#'   appropriate intermodal connector (air or sea port) is chosen instead of
#'   internal zone within the modeled area. The result is a complete truck trip
#'   record at the traffic analysis zone level, for each daily truck trip in the
#'   dataset.
