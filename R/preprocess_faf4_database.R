#' Transform FAF flow database distributed by FHWA into format for target year
#'
#' @param fhwa_db Data frame containing the FAF interregional flow database in
#'   format distributed by FHWA, or string containing path and filename
#'   containing the same
#' @param target_year The four-digit simulation year as an integer value
#' @param interpolate A boolean variable denoting whether values for the
#'   `target_year` should be interpolated between the two closest years if it is
#'   not one of the years included in the FAF database (defaults to FALSE,
#'   currently ignored)
#' @param internal_regions A set of one or more FAF regions internal to the
#'   study area (optional, but must be specified if `external_regions` is
#'   defined)
#' @param external_regions A data frame containing FAF region pairs whose flows
#'   pass through the modeled area (optional, but if specified then
#'   `internal_regions` must also be specified)
#'
#' @details This function converts the FHWA Freight Analysis Framework (FAF)
#'   commodity flows, measured in annual tons, dollars, and ton-miles
#'   between domestic FAF regions and external regions into annual flows
#'   for the specified year or closest to it in the FAF database. The `fhwa_db`
#'   can either be a data frame previously created with the contents of the
#'   FAF flow database or a fully-qualified pathname to the data in comma-
#'   separated value (CSV) format. The latter can be in a compressed format that
#'   readr::read_csv() can handle.
#'
#'   It is important to note that the tons, value, and ton-miles are converted
#'   from implied thousands and millions of units in the source data. Zero
#'   values are retained, as they reportedly represent flows whose values are
#'   less than 1 unit (e.g., zero tons represent values between zero and one
#'   thousand tons since in the FAF tons are coded in implied thousands of
#'   tons).
#'
#'   The `target_year` must be one of the years in the FAF database, or fall
#'   between two of the years included within it. Only data for the target or
#'   closest year is processed by this function. An optional `interpolate`
#'   parameter will eventually allow for the tons, value, and ton-miles to be
#'   interpolated between the two closest years to the target year. The
#'   parameter is included so as to not break the interface, but the
#'   functionality is not currently implemented.
#'
#'   The `internal_regions` should be specified as a list of the FAF regions
#'   inside the modeled area. Flows to, from, and between these internal
#'   regions will be allocated to synthetic firms or traffic analysis zones
#'   within the model. Flows from the remainder of the USA will be retained if
#'   they have a trip end in one of the internal regions (e.g., internal,
#'   inbound, or outbound flows). The internal regions are optional, but if
#'   omitted data from the entire USA will be considered internal to the model.
#'
#'   Flows likely to pass through one or more internal regions can be included
#'   as `external_regions`. Such flows must be defined as FAF region pairs (e.g.,
#'   truck flows between California and Washington on I-5 if Oregon comprises
#'   the internal regions). The flows are assumed to be bidirectional to reduce
#'   the amount of coding required. Note that any additional fields in
#'   `external_regions` will be added to the FAF flows records. The user should
#'   remove any unwanted fields before or after passing the `outer_region`
#'   definitions to this function.
