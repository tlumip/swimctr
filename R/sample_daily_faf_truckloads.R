#' Sample daily truck trips from annual FAF flow database
#'
#' @param annual_faf_trucks A tibble containing the annual truckload equivalents
#'   (discrete truck records) generated from the FAF commodity flow database
#' @param target_day The day of the week the flows are sampled for (default = 4,
#'   which corresponds to Wednesday)
#'
#' @details This function samples daily truck trips from FAF annual truckload
#'   equivalents. It samples for a designated day of the week in the first week
#'   of the year, as the current version does not include monthly or weekly flow
#'   percentages by SCTG or other variables. A tibble is returned with the
#'   sampled daily truck trips.
