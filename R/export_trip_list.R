#' Export local and inter-regional trip records in a combined trip list file
#'
#' @param hourly_faf_trips A tibble containing the final inter-regional flows,
#'   with origin, destination, and departure time appended for each trip
#' @param hourly_local_trips A tibble containing the final local truck tour
#'   flows, with origin, destination, and departure time appended for each trip
#'
#' @details This function will typically be the last part of the model to run,
#'   for it combines the local and inter-regional truck trip records into a
#'   single trip file, with common fields for both. Missing values are inserted
#'   for data present in one dataset, but not in the other. The result is a
#'   tibble with trips from both datasets in common value expected by later
#'   SWIM2 components. Code NULL if one of the input tibbles is to be skipped
#'   during model testing.
